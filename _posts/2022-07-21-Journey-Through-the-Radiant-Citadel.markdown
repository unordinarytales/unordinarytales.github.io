Yesterday I went down to my FLGS and picked up the Journeys through the Radiant Citadel from Wizards of the Coast and I am highly impressed (see below for the cover). I went with the alternate cover, and I am looking forward to diving into the book.

I love the cartography too as I am a giant map nerd.

Beyond that though the book just sets up the game as a welcoming and inclusive space.

And especially the following section.

  These are the kind of D&D books we need and I want to see more. I can't wait to use this at the table.
