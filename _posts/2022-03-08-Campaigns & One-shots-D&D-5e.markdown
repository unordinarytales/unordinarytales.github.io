I am now four sessions into the first campaign that I’ve run in Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition. The campaign is largely city-based taking place in a large metropolis, and is thematically Indiana Jones meets Gangs of New York. It has none of the traditional ancestries and I’ve turned the dials on the game. I may end up doing a post or two on the game though I am not sure yet.
