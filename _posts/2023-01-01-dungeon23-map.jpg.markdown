I am participating in the Dungeon 23 project this year, [which had a great write-up in Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/dungeon23-2023-ttrpg-writing-challenge-roleplaying-game-1849930262).

> Dungeon23 is a daily writing practice that is built around game design. Every day the participant will design another room in a dungeon, and at the end of the week they will have a complete level. The next week starts the process over until you have 52 dungeon levels.

Now I am going to try to participate though I will be doing a city rather than a dungeon so I don't know how far I will get in the process. I have created a side blog to track my progress (lack thereof). I will probably link back to it periodically though since I hope to be creating something every day that could be a lot.
