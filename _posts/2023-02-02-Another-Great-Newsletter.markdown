MT Black recently included the link below in their legendary newsletter[ (see prior post)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-01-26-Newsletter-Recommendation %}) and I wanted to include it as I have vacillated between different tools for creating a game/campaign wiki (which I would put in a different league than GM notebook and world bible). This would be for the players to let them know about in-game lore and other information.

(We have tried a few different tools: [Notion](https://www.notion.so), [World Anvil](https://www.worldanvil.com), and then a [wiki in Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence). Lately, I have been toying with trying [a blog on Tumblr.](https://www.tumblr.com))

> Recently I came back to one I had used far in the past and realized the new version is even better and more accessible for campaign wikis – Google Sites. I’d built with this quite some time ago, but they have recently revamped their service and I find it even easier to use.
