Lately, I have been thinking about how to play more games. I play in a regular weekly game though I have realized that there are too many games I want to try for the weekly game to accommodate and also have a long-running game. I have some ideas though I am not sure how to approach the problem. Does anyone have any good ideas? How do you swap through games in your group?
