During the giant pastrami/panini, I have returned to tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) after a long hiatus, which has been amazing and has helped with everything. I last regularly played D&D during that 3.0/3.5 era and now the game is on its 5th edition with another set for release in another few years. In returning to the game it had been interesting to see how the game has changed though also how I have changed as a player and also as a person. I hope to be able to share some of those changes plus also some of the game design and content that I have been doing as I return to D&D.
