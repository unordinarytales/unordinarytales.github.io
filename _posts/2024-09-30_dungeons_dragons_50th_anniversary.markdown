## 50th Anniversary Year

My game has been hold for a few weeks due to work and life events that have caused us to fail our save against the scheduling demon. Since we didn’t have a game I thought I could write about the Dungeons and Dragons 50th anniversary.

Since Dungeons and Dragons is to tabletop roleplaying games what Coca-cola is to soda pop there have been many great articles and memorabilia produced to commemorate the milestone year[^1]. This is by no means a complete list

### Look Back Articles

- [NPR asks how Dungeons & Dragons connects listeners : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/20/g-s1-23824/as-dungeons-dragons-turns-50-this-year-we-asked-listeners-for-their-stories-about-the-game-here-are-5)

> Throughout the decades, it’s remained as a way for its most loyal players to socialize with friends and escape to faraway lands. A few weeks ago, we asked readers and listeners to tell us what role the game has played in their lives.

### Postage Stamps

The United States postal service has released official stamps with 50th Anniversary artwork.

### Theater Shows

### Toys

The set includes character mini-figs and classic monsters from the game like owl bears and dragons.

[^1]: We are going to not include the new 5th edition revisions though there is an argument to be made that is the biggest anniversary release.
