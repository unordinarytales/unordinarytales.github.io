## Being Free to Create

Wizards of the Coast is hiring for a "D&D Worldbuilder", which sounds amazing yet after thinking about it I realized why it's better to not have that job.[^1]

> We are hiring a Senior Narrative Worldbuilding Designer for Dungeons & Dragons. In this role, you will create exciting and inspirational new settings and develop existing ones. The settings you create will become part of our ever-expanding multiverse. Working closely with others in our creative team, you will give life to legendary characters, intertwine the narratives of D&D stories across various platforms, and provide new content for internal and external partners to play with across all expressions of D&D. We need a world builder with strong writing skills, a collaborative spirit, and a focused imagination.

TTRPGs have become not only a way to connect with my friends though also a creative outlet that I never knew/realized I needed as an adult.  I had thought about being an author when I was younger though that is a varied and solo occupation that seemed risky. I eventually put away the uncertainty for a more stable job yet I still have some creative ideas once and it wasn't till got back into TTRPGs did that creativity have an outlet. 

Coming up with adventures and world building provides a creative space for me much like music or baking for others I know. It's a venue to experiment and test ideas while growing skills otherwise untested. And I wouldn't want that weighted down under by a paycheck. I am sure others can handle being creative for work, but it wouldn't work for me. I prefer to be a serious hobbyist at best.  If I had a job in TTRPGs then it could no longer be my hobby. All that being said though I wish whoever gets this job the best and look forward to following their work.
