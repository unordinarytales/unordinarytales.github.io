I was reading this article on the state of ttrpgs in 2023 and this struck me as relevant after my group's foray into different systems looking for a new Star Wars rpg.

> Make games, not systems. A lot of TTRPG systems have been made with the intention of being extremely accessible and flexible, but do not have a game that really makes them stand out at release. Companies want their own tentpole mechanical system so they're not dependent from any other (like Dungeons & Dragons' infamous Open Gaming License). But while I admire a lot of this innovation, I want more games. I want games that are built up around a system, or a system that is specifically designed for a game, that supports the game from the ground up.
