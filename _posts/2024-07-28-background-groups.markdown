## We can't all meet in a tavern
I am sure everyone has experienced a game (or two) where the party meets in a tavern on some long night after traveling all day. The GM asks each player to describe their character and a new adventuring party is born. 

There is no rule though that the characters have to meet in the game. It is often easier if the characters all have a predefined connection[^1] before the game begins as it ties the characters together and you don't need to role-play those scenes (i.e. You look into their eyes across the table to discern if you can trust them...).

[In Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition,](https://dnd.wizards.com/start-playing-dnd) the character Background is a great way to embed these connections. If you can integrate a singular party patron into the group backgrounds I think that can also add value; that way you have a singular connection point across the party while also having a way to hook the party into the game. 


### Knights of Danathrin
The Knights of Danathrin are a martial order that has a presence throughout Faedestrere offering their services as mercenaries. They can secure a merchant's premises from break-ins, aid the city watch in investigations, or help track down missing goods. 

Emulating their founder Lord Danathrin, the Knights are honor-bound to hold their oaths and help their community.  Outside of martial services, they also provide other services like banking, information brokerage, and mail services. They have garrisons throughout the Upper World and some throughout the Sunken Sea.
