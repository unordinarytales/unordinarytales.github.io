## Visiting the Twenty-sided Tavern

My game group plays virtually though we have been trying to meetup in realspace from time to time and in the beginning of August we all boarded a plane to [New York, NY to see the show at the Twenty-sided Tavern](https://thetwentysidedtavern.com/).

The show is part live Dungeons and Dragons game and part improv show with a hefty dose of audience participation. Nestled in a small theater near Times Square with wall-sized Faerun maps, a life-size mimic statue, and coat of arms the show begins with a live session-zero esque character selection. The audience votes on the characters the actors play while the Dungeon Master explains the rules, and then the adventure commences.

The three actors all were excellent during our show and really brought the characters to life embodying the improv nature to the show with a Dungeons and Dragons flair. I wonâ€™t spoil the adventure the though will say it combines all the elements that make Dungeons and Dragons the game we love and it brings the game to a whole new medium.


Here is the article my spouse first sent me about the show:

> The interactive play is the first offical stage production based on the hit tabletop role-playing game, which celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2024.
