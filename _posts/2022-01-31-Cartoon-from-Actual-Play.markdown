I watched the initial episodes of [Vox Machina](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11247158/) this weekend and was rather impressed by the story and how well they have translated Dungeons and Dragons to the screen. I look forward to the rest of the series and hopefully more beyond the series (either more Vox Machina or Mighty Nein).
